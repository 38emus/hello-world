# hello-world
Creating my first repo on GitHub.

The point of this hello world repo is to get more familiar with GitHub and how it works.
I also believe Bigfoot exist.

I also have a thing for wanting to build thing and like projects that will have an end at some point so that the next project can be picked up.
Also why are they called bratwurst?

I'm testing with giberish! (If that's how you spell it???)
